Bare-metal-OS Quick Start Guide
===============================

This Quick Start Guide describes how to use CSC DCAF Automation to provision an
OS on bare-metal hardware, currently RHEL OS. It uses the following resources:

- `dcaf/bare-metal-os <https://github.com/csc/dcaf/bare-metal-os>`_ - An
  automated deployment of an operating system to bare-metal hardware using Hanlon,
  currently the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS.

- `Hanlon <https://github.com/csc/Hanlon>`_ - As an advanced provisioning
  platform which can provision both bare-metal and virtual systems.

Before You Begin
----------------

Ensure that the following requirements are met:

Physical Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DCAF was developed and tested with the following hardware:

- DELL PowerEdge 630 | PowerEdge 730
- DELL PERC H730 RAID Controller

The physical hardware being deployed to meet the following:

- The physical hardware has been installed and connected to the network
- A 1GB connection for OOB management on the management switch
- 2 10GbE connections to the 10GbE network switches
- The upstream and management network are pre-configured
- The out-of-band management IP addresses are pre-configured
- IPMI is enabled on each host

Network Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several network requirements for the deployment.

- DNS server IP addresses need to be provided
- NTP server IP address needs to be provided
- The following VLANS are required:

  - Out-of-band management (IPMI)
  - PXE Network

- Out-of-band Network IP address for each node
- Management IP address for each node

Run Bare-metal-OS Automation
----------------------------

The Bare-metal-OS module will deploy an operating system on bare-metal hardware.
This module requires a base inventory.

Create the Inventory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The inventory is managed by the :code:`hosts.ini` file. The format and contents of
this file will vary depending on the what automation is being used. For more information
and examples of this file refer to the CSC DCAF project documentation.

- **hosts.ini** - Create or edit the ``/opt/autodeploy/projects/inventory/hosts.ini``
  file by copying the contents of the ``opt/autodeploy/projects/dcaf/modules/bare-metal-os/inventory/host_vars/example_host.ini`` and modifying as needed. This file should
  contain the DNS resolvable names of the hosts being deployed to.

.. note::

  The :code:`hosts.ini` will contain :code:`[group]` headings that correspond to
  a module or the role the host will have within the module. Each :code:`[group]` name
  should match the corresponding ``inventory/group_vars/groupname.yml`` group variable
  file. If editing this file append to it and ensure there is no duplication. All
  hosts listed should be under a :code:`group` heading.

.. code-block:: yaml

    [bare_metal_os] ``(name of the module group variable file)``
    hostname1
    hostname2
    ...

Modify Host & Module Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module uses multiple variables that are managed in two separate files. The
``inventory/host_vars/host_name.yml`` file contains host specific variables and the
``inventory/group_vars/bare_metal_os.yml`` file contains module specific variables.

- **host_name.yml** - There should be a ``/opt/autodeploy/projects/inventory/host_vars/host_name.yml``
  for each host in the hosts.ini file. Create or edit these files by copying the contents
  of the ``opt/autodeploy/projects/dcaf/modules/bare-metal-os/inventory/host_vars/example_host.ini``
  and modifying as needed.

.. note::

  Each :code:`host.yml` file must include the host hardware :code:`smbios-uuid`.
  This can be found using the hosts vendor management tools. Refer to the vendor
  documentation for more information.

- **bare_metal_os.yml** - Copy the ``/opt/autodeploy/projects/dcaf/modules/bare-metal-os/inventory/group_vars/bare_metal_os.yml`` file to the ``/opt/autodeploy/projects/inventory/group_vars/``
  folder and modify as needed per the environment.

Prepare Hosts for Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the ``bare-metal-os/site_reset.yml`` playbook to power cycle the hosts and have
them discovered by Hanlon: â€‹

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /opt/autodeploy/projects/dcaf/modules/bare-metal-os
    ansible-playbook site_reset.yml

Deploy the OS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next run the ``bare-metal-os/site_deploy.yml`` playbook to deploy the RHEL OS to
the hosts in inventory:

.. code-block:: bash

    ansible-playbook site_deploy.yml

At this point the RHEL OS has been installed and configured on all hosts listed
in the ``/opt/autodeploy/projects/inventory/hosts.ini``.
